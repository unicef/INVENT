      <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed a bug that (incorrectly) informed users that help widget form submissions were unsuccessful. Bonus:
          added the page on which the user submitted the form to the metadata, providing additional context when
          analysing help requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed a bug where discontinued, completed or deleted initiatives incorrectly generated notifications prompting
          users to keep them up to date
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Goal areas and Result areas</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Goal Areas and Result Areas to reflect the current Strategic Plan</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Portfolio reviews</h4>

        <li>Deactivated reminder notifications for the deprecated Portfolio Review functionality</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Administration</h4>

        <li>
          Added configuration option to reduce spam by sending all new taxonomy requests (software, hardware,... ) to
          INVENT team email address instead of all superusers
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Display UNICEF office name on initiative cards</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Dataviz</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow admins to set the latitude and longitude of UNICEF offices. This will allow dataviz e.g., Magasin, to
          position initiatives more precisely on a map
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow a solution to be tagged with a funding source of Set Aside 2021 or Set Aside 2022. This will support

      <h3 id="3.8.0">INVENT 3.8.0</h3>
      <p>Deployed: 2023-09-11</p>
      <h4>Allow users to delete initiatives</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can now delete any initiative that they are able to edit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Notify users when their taxonomy requests are approved or declined</h4>
      <p>
        Users have always been able to request new entries in the taxonomy fields in the Technology section when
        creating/editing an initiative, allowing administrators to approve or decline these requests. This release
        enhances this workflow by providing feedback to users who have made such requests.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inform users when an administrator approves or declines their request for a new taxonomy tag in the Technology
          section of the form
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow administrators to add a comment when approving/declining a request, and display this comment in the
          notification email to the user
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Technology playbook integration</h4>
      <p>
        To support the soft integration between INVENT and the Technology Playbook, this release adds a link to each
        phase on the create/edit initiative form, allowing users to consult the relevant content of the Playbook.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow administrators to define a url for each phase. If this url is provided, a Learn more link will be
          displayed when to users when they expand the phase description.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Solutions</h4>
      <p>
        The notion of a solution previously existed in INVENT to model the solutions in the innovation portfolios. This
        has now been generalised to support work that is not in an innovation portfolio.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow solutions to exist outside of portfolios</li>
        <li>Move Solutions from under portfolios/innovation/solutions to top level of site hierarchy</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Other</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve email template (e.g., cosmetic changes, fix broken / incorrect links,â€¦)</li>
        <li>
          Improve synchronisation of INVENT's user list (displayed when you add a team member) with UNICEF's directory
          (technical improvement)
        </li>
        <li>Improve management of translation texts during deployments (technical improvement)</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3 id="3.7.0">INVENT 3.7.0</h3>
      <p>Deployed: 2023-08-11</p>
      <h4>Improved country office page.</h4>
      <p>Introducing the new Country Office board!</p>
      <p>
        This board allows anyone to see the status of a CO's initiatives, by sector, including a highlight of those
        initiatives that have not changed phase in over 6 months.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guide shared separately</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Admin</h4>
      <p>
        Improve configuration of initiative phases to allow an admin to select which phases represent the end of active
        work on an initiative. Currently set as Handover and Complete and Discontinued. This will allow INVENT to adapt
        to changes in underlying processes.
      </p>
      <h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>
      <p>
        Improve UX when viewing initiatives by using Initiatives as the breadcrumbs text instead of My initiatives.
        (Unfortunately, for technical reasons, this value is shared, so this change fixes most page views (in the
        inventory) but means that the My initiatives page shows Initiatives and links to the Inventory)
      </p>

      <h4>Initiative management</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>

          they had previously signed into INVENT.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select a user as a focal point. In previous versions users has to type a name and an email address. This
          didn't allow any kind of autocompletion, and created bugs when the email address didn't match a UNICEF

      <h3 id="2.9.6">INVENT v2.9.6</h3>
      <p>Deployed: 2022-02-02</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lists of initiatives now include a column called Current phase that indicates the inferred current phase. The
          inferred current phase of an initiative is determined as follows:
        </li>
        <li>
          If no phase is marked as completed, then the current phase is the first phase (Opportunity and Ideation)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the last completed phase is Handover or Completed or Discontinued then this phase is retained as the
          current phase, as it is an end state for an initiative.
        </li>
        <li>
          In all other cases, the current phase is set to the phase immediately following the last completed phase.
        </li>
        <li>The multi-select Current phase filter filters on the new Current phase field.</li>
        <li>Exports now include the Current phase column</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented accessing a published initiative directly via saved/shared URL</li>
        <li>Other minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
      </ul>

          that caused this date to appear has been fixed
        </li>
        <li>
          An error that caused the export of some EAPRO initiatives to fail has been fixed (cause: special characters in
